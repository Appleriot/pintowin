								<h2>One Sport Fits All</h2>
								<p>Wrestling is the oldest sport known to man. Wrestling is for ALL people (tall, short, big, small, male, female, fast, slow, etc.). The Pin To Win Wrestling Program is here to help all inspired wrestling athletes, coaches, referees, managers, and parents reach their fullest possible potential in life. As our mascot, The Student Athlete, symbolizes the two most important areas in the Pin To Win Wrestling Program and that is to EDUCATE AND TRAIN. The Pin To Win staff is very dedicated to the upkeep of our teammates in-class behavior and performance as well as the sportsmanship, attitude, and success during competitions and other P2W events. The P2W wrestling curriculum is broken into 3 phases. This brilliant three phase curriculum will simply educate our teammates from the well known basics of wrestling to the smartest and trickiest wrestling maneuvers, strategies, and techniques. </p>
